These delightful mini cheesecakes, complete with a graham cracker base, are perfect for serving up classic dessert in individual portions. This recipe yields approximately 24 mini cheesecakes.

*Ingredients*

*For the Graham Cracker Crust:*
- *1 1/2 cups* graham cracker crumbs (about 12-14 full-sheet graham crackers)
- *1/4 cup* granulated sugar
- *6 tablespoons* unsalted butter, melted

*For the Cheesecake Filling:*
- *2 cups (16 ounces)* cream cheese, room temperature (use full-fat for the best texture)
- *2/3 cup* granulated sugar
- *1/2 cup* sour cream, room temperature
- *1 teaspoon* vanilla extract
- *2* large eggs, room temperature
- Optional toppings: fruit, whipped cream, chocolate chips, or any favorite toppings

*Equipment*
- Standard muffin tin
- Paper cupcake liners
- Mixing bowls
- Electric mixer (stand or hand)

*Instructions*

*1. Preheat the Oven and Prepare the Tins*
- Preheat your oven to 325°F (163°C).
- Line the muffin tin with paper liners to prevent sticking and for easy removal.

*2. Make the Graham Cracker Crust*
1. *Combine* the crust ingredients in a bowl: graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup sugar, and melted butter until well combined.
2. *Press* a heaping tablespoon of the mixture into each muffin cup. Press down to form a solid crust.
3. *Bake* the crusts for 5 minutes, then remove from the oven.

*3. Prepare the Cheesecake Filling*
1. *Beat* the cream cheese and 2/3 cup sugar on medium speed until smooth and creamy.
2. *Mix* in the sour cream and vanilla extract, then add the eggs one at a time, mixing on low speed just until combined. Avoid overmixing.
3. *Pour* the cheesecake filling over the crusts in the muffin tins, filling each almost to the top.

*4. Bake*
- Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until the centers slightly jiggle when gently shaken.
- Let them cool in the tin for an hour before transferring to the refrigerator. Chill for at least 2 hours, or overnight.

*5. Add Toppings and Serve*
- Once chilled, add any desired toppings to your mini cheesecakes.
- Remove from the tin and peel away the paper liners before serving.

*Tips*
- *Room-temperature ingredients* ensure a smooth filling without lumps.
- *Chilling thoroughly* before serving allows the cheesecakes to set and makes them easier to remove from the liners.

Enjoy these perfect party-sized cheesecakes!
