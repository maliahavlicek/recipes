*High-Altitude Oatmeal Butterscotch Chip Cookies Recipe*

Baking at a high altitude like 5280 feet requires some adjustments to your standard recipes. Here's how you can modify your oatmeal butterscotch chip cookies for better results:

*Ingredients Adjustments for High Altitude*

- *Flour*: 3 cups + 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour (an increase to add structure)
- *Brown Sugar*: 2 cups, packed (minus 2 tablespoons to reduce concentration)
- *Granulated Sugar*: 1 cup (minus 2 tablespoons to avoid overspreading)
- *Butter*: 2 cups (4 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
- *Eggs*: 4 large
- *Vanilla Extract*: 2 teaspoons
- *Baking Soda*: 2 teaspoons (minus 1/4 teaspoon to regulate rise)
- *Salt*: 1 teaspoon
- *Ground Cinnamon*: 1 teaspoon
- *Ground Ginger*: 1/2 teaspoon
- *Ground Cloves*: 1/2 teaspoon (optional, adjust to taste)
- *Old-Fashioned Oats*: 4 cups
- *Butterscotch Chips*: 2 cups
- *Chopped Walnuts*: 1 cup
- *Chopped Pecans*: 1 cup

_Note: For liquid adjustments, if the dough is too dry, add 1-2 tablespoons of milk or water._

*Baking Adjustments*

- *Oven Temperature*: Increase by 25°F to 375°F (190°C). 
- *Baking Time*: Start checking for doneness a bit earlier than usual due to the temperature increase.

*Instructions*

1. *Preheat* your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line cookie sheets with parchment paper.
2. *Cream* the butter and sugars together until light and fluffy. Add in the eggs one at a time, then the vanilla.
3. *Whisk* together the dry ingredients (flour, baking soda, salt, and spices) in a separate bowl.
4. *Gradually combine* the dry ingredients with the wet, stirring just until incorporated.
5. *Fold in* the oats, butterscotch chips, and nuts evenly.
6. *Drop* the dough by rounded spoonfuls onto the prepared sheets, about 2 inches apart.
7. *Bake* for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden. The centers should remain soft.
8. *Cool* on the sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to wire racks.

Remember, adjustments might need fine-tuning based on specific conditions and oven variances. Start with these recommendations and tweak further as necessary.

Enjoy your high-altitude baking adventure!
